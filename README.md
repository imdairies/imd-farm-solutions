1) When a new calf is born generate a sequence of events e.g. Weighing the calf once every two weeks starting from birth, dehorning x week after the birth, deworming x month after the birth, FMD vaccination x months after birth etc.
2) Create a rule template which should have variables that we can control for each farm and we should be able to enable/disable that rule for each farm e.g. 1) Dry-Off a cow three months before expected parturation, 2)Expected heat 20 days after the last heat, 3) Check pregnancy if the cow has been inseminated 60 days ago etc.
